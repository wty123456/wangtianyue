We always knew our daughter Kendall was going be a performer of some sort. She entertained people in our small town by putting on shows on our front porch when she was only three or four. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed, and beautiful, she sang like a little angel and mesmerized1 everyone.
 
When Kendall was five, we began to notice that she was blinking a lot and clearing her throat frequently. We had her tested for allergies2, but the doctor said she wasn't allergic3 to anything at all. After the problem worsened, we took her to our local children's hospital where she was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome4.
